-- Detail script for Indicator 19: Total Number of Exposed Infants on Follow up and Care at end of this quarter
-- Formula: Previous quarter on care + New enrollments + Transfers in
-- Parameters: @StartDate, @EndDate
-- 
-- Formula breakdown (from Rinfants.Designer.vb):
-- Male: xMP (previous quarter) + XrTableCell710 (new + transfer) - XrTableCell686 (left care)
-- Female: XrTableCell503 (previous quarter) + XrTableCell711 (new + transfer) - XrTableCell687 (left care)
-- Where:
--   xMP/XrTableCell503 = Previous quarter on care (from Exposed() function)
--     - DafirstVisit < Sdate (enrolled before current quarter)
--     - AND (DaStatus empty OR DaStatus >= Sdate) (still on care at start of current quarter)
--   XrTableCell710 = New enrollments (M_less2 + M_great2) + Transfer in (M_less2 + M_great2)
--     - DafirstVisit BETWEEN Sdate AND Edate
--     - New: Offin <> 1
--     - Transfer: Offin = 1
--   XrTableCell711 = New enrollments (F_less2 + F_great2) + Transfer in (F_less2 + F_great2)
--   XrTableCell686/XrTableCell687 = Empty (0) in Designer, so no subtraction
--
-- This query shows all patients who are on care at the end of this quarter:
-- = Previous quarter patients (on care at start) + New enrollments + Transfers in
