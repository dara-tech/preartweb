# Reengagement Data Analysis

## Overview
Analysis of patient reengagement data for missed appointments, showing how many patients returned to care within 28 days vs. after 28+ days.

## Key Findings

### Indicator 3: Reengaged Within 28 Days
- **Total Missed Appointments:** 11
- **Reengaged Within 28 Days:** 9
- **Reengagement Rate:** 81.82%

**Breakdown by Demographics:**
- **Male 15+:** 7 missed, 6 reengaged (86% rate) ✅ Excellent
- **Female 15+:** 4 missed, 3 reengaged (75% rate) ✅ Good
- **Children (0-14):** 0 missed appointments

**Analysis:**
- Strong early reengagement rate (81.82%)
- Male patients show slightly better reengagement (86% vs 75%)
- No missed appointments among pediatric patients in this period
- Most patients return within the first 28 days

### Indicator 4: Reengaged After 28+ Days
- **Total Missed Appointments:** 11 (same base as Indicator 3)
- **Reengaged After 28+ Days:** 1
- **Reengagement Rate:** 9.09% (1 out of 11)

**Breakdown by Demographics:**
- **Male 15+:** 1 missed, 1 reengaged (100% rate)
- **Female 15+:** 0 missed, 0 reengaged
- **Children (0-14):** 0 missed appointments

**Analysis:**
- Only 1 patient returned after 28+ days
- This represents 9.09% of total missed appointments
- Combined with Indicator 3: 10 out of 11 patients (90.91%) eventually reengaged
- 1 patient (9.09%) has not reengaged yet

## Overall Insights

### Reengagement Summary
- **Total Missed:** 11 appointments
- **Reengaged Within 28 Days:** 9 (81.82%)
- **Reengaged After 28+ Days:** 1 (9.09%)
- **Total Reengaged:** 10 (90.91%)
- **Not Yet Reengaged:** 1 (9.09%)

### Key Metrics
1. **Early Reengagement (≤28 days):** 81.82% - Very good
2. **Late Reengagement (>28 days):** 9.09% - Low
3. **Overall Reengagement:** 90.91% - Excellent
4. **Lost to Follow-up:** 9.09% - Needs attention

### Recommendations
1. **Maintain Current Efforts:** The 81.82% early reengagement rate is strong
2. **Focus on Late Reengagers:** Only 1 patient returned after 28+ days - consider enhanced follow-up
3. **Address the 1 Non-Reengaged Patient:** 9.09% have not returned - may need targeted outreach
4. **Monitor Gender Patterns:** Slight difference between male (86%) and female (75%) early reengagement
5. **Pediatric Care:** No missed appointments in pediatric population - good performance

### Data Quality Notes
- Both indicators should show the same "Total Missed Appointments" (11)
- The breakdown shows consistency across indicators
- Demographic breakdowns align with overall totals

## Technical Notes
- Indicator 3 and Indicator 4 use the same base of missed appointments
- Indicator 3 counts reengagements within 28 days
- Indicator 4 counts reengagements after 28 days
- A patient can only appear in one category (within 28 days OR after 28+ days)
- The sum of both indicators should equal total reengaged patients (9 + 1 = 10)
